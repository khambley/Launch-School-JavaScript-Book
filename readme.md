# Introduction to Programming with JavaScript  
This repo contains my solutions to the coding exercises contained in the Introduction to Programming with JavaScript book [here](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript).
1. The Basics
    1. Data type
    2. Operations
    3. Explicit Coercion <--weird sounding word!
    4. Data Structures
        1. Arrays
        2. Objects  
            * A JavaScript object is a collection of key-value pairs.  
            `{ dog: 'barks', cat: 'meows', pig: 'oinks' }`  
            * To retrieve value by its key:  
            `({ dog: 'barks', cat: 'meows', pig: 'oinks' })['cat']` = 'meows'  
        3. Expressions and Return Values  
            * An expression is anything that JavaScript can evaluate to a value (including undefined and null).  
            * Expressions do something, but they also return or evaluate to a value. Example:  
            `console.log('Hi!')` prints Hi to the screen but returns `undefined` as the value.  
        4. Statements  
            * A complete list on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements). 
            * Statements always evaluate as `undefined` 
            * A statement is a syntactic unit that expresses an operation to be carried out.
